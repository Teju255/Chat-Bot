1. Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js: Version 14.x or later
npm: Node package manager (comes with Node.js)
You can download and install Node.js from nodejs.org.

2. Clone the Repository
Clone the repository containing the chatbot code:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-repository/chatbot.git
cd chatbot
Replace https://github.com/your-repository/chatbot.git with the URL of your repository.

3. Install Dependencies
Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
This command will install all the necessary packages listed in package.json.

4. Run the Development Server
Start the development server to run the application:

bash
Copy code
npm start
This will start the React development server and open the application in your default web browser at http://localhost:3000.

5. Access the Chatbot
Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to interact with the chatbot.

6. Build for Production
To create a production build of the application, run:

bash
Copy code
npm run build
This will generate a build directory with the optimized production build.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
